To set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable with the value `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` in the Zsh shell on macOS, you can follow these steps:

1. **Open Terminal:** Launch Terminal on your Mac.

2. **Edit the `.zshrc` File:** Use a text editor like `nano`, `vim`, or `TextEdit` to edit the `~/.zshrc` file.

   Using `nano` in the Terminal:

   ```bash
   nano ~/.zshrc
   ```

3. **Add the Environment Variable:** Inside the `.zshrc` file, add the following line:

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="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"
   ```

4. **Save and Exit the Editor:** 

   - For `nano`: Use `Ctrl + X` to exit, then press `Y` to confirm changes, and hit `Enter` to save.
   - For other text editors, follow their specific instructions to save the file and exit.

5. **Apply Changes:** Run the following command to apply the changes to the current Terminal session:

   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

6. **Verify Environment Variable:**

   To verify if the environment variable has been set, you can echo its value:

   ```bash
   echo $OPENAI_API_KEY
   ```

   This command should display the value you've assigned to `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

7. **Restart Terminal:** Close and reopen Terminal to ensure the changes take effect in new terminal sessions.

Once completed, the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable with the specified value will be available in your Zsh shell and persist across sessions, allowing you to use it within your scripts or applications that rely on this API key.
